## About Me

Alongside many others working as engineers, my background is in physics.
As an undergraduate I conducted research on genereating Laguerre-Gaussian modes in optical and electron beams
under the supervision of Benjamin McMorran.

While completing a Masters in Applied Optical Physics, I developed software to aid in the
design of 3D printed gradient index (GRIN) phase plates for optical testing aboard NASAâ€™s
James Webb Space Telescope. I then went on to construct a scanning Mach-Zehnder interferometer
to validate the phase profiles of the GRIN plates after fabrication.

After spending a few wonderful years at Brewer Science in Missouri working to commercialize
printable carbon nanotube sensors I moved on to the Backman Biophotonics Lab at Northwestern University.
Here at Northwestern I work to build a solid research infrastructure to support the lab's cutting-edge research.
This includes developing data analysis pipelines, constructing custom microscopes, creating new types of calibration
samples and procedures, and much more.
